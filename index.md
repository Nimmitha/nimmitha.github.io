## About
I work at the intersection of experimental high-energy physics, data analysis, and reproducible software workflows. My focus is building robust analysis pipelines and machine-learning tools for signal/background discrimination in large scientific datasets.

---

## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** Python, C++, SQL, Bash  
- **Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, XGBoost  
- **Scientific Computing:** ROOT, PyROOT, CMSSW, Coffea  
- **Data Analysis:** statistical modeling, regression, uncertainty estimation  
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, HPC clusters, Matplotlib

## Experience
### PhD Researcher — Data Analysis & Machine Learning (2019–Present)
**University of Tennessee, Knoxville**
- Designed and executed large-scale data analysis pipelines on multi-terabyte datasets
- Built ML classifiers to separate signal and background events
- Performed statistical modeling, regression fits, and uncertainty propagation
- Developed end-to-end workflows for simulation, reconstruction, and validation
- Optimized processing using vectorized operations and batch processing
- Collaborated in a 1000+ member international collaboration (CMS)

## Selected Projects
### ML-based Signal Discrimination
- Trained neural networks and random forest models on high-dimensional datasets
- Performed feature engineering and evaluated performance using ROC curves
- Integrated ML outputs into statistical analysis workflows

### High-Throughput Data Processing
- Processed millions of events using Python/C++ analysis pipelines
- Implemented custom binning and caching strategies to reduce runtime
