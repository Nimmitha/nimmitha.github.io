# High-Throughput Data Processing

## Summary
Designed analysis pipelines for large scientific datasets, focusing on performance, correctness, and traceable outputs.

## What I did
- Built event processing pipelines with vectorized operations
- Implemented uneven binning strategies to control statistical uncertainties
- Added logging/QA checks to catch malformed inputs and edge cases
- Streamlined batch processing on Linux/HPC environments

## Tools
Python, Bash, Git, ROOT, Coffea (as applicable)
