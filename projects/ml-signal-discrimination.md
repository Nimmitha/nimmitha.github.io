# ML-based Signal Discrimination

## Summary
Built and evaluated ML classifiers to separate signal and background events in high-energy physics datasets, with an emphasis on reproducible workflows and interpretable performance metrics.

## What I did
- Trained baseline and tuned models (e.g., tree-based + neural network approaches)
- Feature engineering and dataset balancing strategies
- Evaluated performance with ROC/AUC and stability checks across conditions
- Produced plots and summaries suitable for analysis notes and presentations

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, ROOT/CMSSW
